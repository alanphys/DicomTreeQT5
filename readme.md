#DicomTreeQT5 Readme file 

##1) Introduction
There are many DICOM tag viewers available. None of them seem to do exactly
what I want, therefore this simple app.

##2) Licence
Please read the file Licence.txt. This means that if as a result of using this
program you fry your patients, trash your linac, nuke the cat, blow the city
power in a ten block radius and generally cause global thermonuclear meltdown!
Sorry, I did warn you!

##3) System Requirements
Currently running on Fedora 28/KDE 5.13/QT 5.11 <br>
Windows users will need to install a python stack (such as anaconda) and QT5.

##4) Dependencies
* PySide2
* pydicom

##5) Installation
Copy the files into a directory

##6) Use
Open a console window, change to the above directory and run<br>

favourite file manager is also supported.
